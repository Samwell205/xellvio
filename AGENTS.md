- International card payments use Flutterwave server-side (src/lib/flw.server.ts, webhook /api/public/card/webhook, refs icp_); never name the provider in UI — owner requirement.
- Toll-free registration uses one shared three-step wizard for tenant and verifier accounts so both submission experiences stay aligned with the carrier flow.
- Dashboard lifecycle card visibility is centralized in src/lib/lifecycle/visibility.ts so prior dismissal state cannot hide required workspace guidance.
